# 📊 Applied Statistics Project – Performance Analysis & Statistical Modeling

📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the Applied Statistics module and is divided into three comprehensive parts, each covering real-world scenarios to apply statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and data visualization. The objective is to solve business and performance problems using Python, statistical methods, and EDA techniques.

⸻

🧠 Part A: Probability & Distribution-Based Case Studies

✨ Summary:

This section addresses a set of structured probability and statistical distribution questions, covering:
	•	Joint probabilities
	•	Binomial distributions (product defects)
	•	Poisson distributions (car sales)
	•	Multinomial probabilities (voice bot accuracy)
	•	Real-world use case of applied statistics in industry

📈 Concepts Covered:
	•	Conditional and joint probability
	•	Binomial and Poisson distribution
	•	Cumulative distribution plotting using Matplotlib
	•	Real-world application of statistical reasoning

🏀 Part B: Basketball Team Performance Analytics

📊 Dataset:

DS - Part2 - Basketball.csv – Performance stats for basketball teams including games played, wins, baskets scored, highest rank, etc.

🧩 Objective:

To analyze basketball teams’ performance and recommend potential high-performing teams to invest in, based on past performance metrics.

🔍 Key Steps:
	•	Data cleaning and preparation
	•	Feature engineering for metrics like win rate, basket efficiency
	•	Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA
	•	Visual storytelling using bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots
	•	Strategic team recommendations based on:
	•	Win percentage
	•	Basket differentials
	•	Historical performance
	•	Team launch year (new vs old teams)

📌 Outcome:

An executive summary with top-performing teams, high potential underdogs, and data-driven insights to assist Company X in partnership decisions.

⸻

🚀 Part C: Startup Success & Funding Analysis

📊 Dataset:

DS - Part3 - CompanyX_EU.csv – Contains startup funding data, results from a pitch competition, and operating state of companies.

🧩 Objective:

To explore and analyze the factors that influence startup success, especially focusing on their funding and operational status.

🧪 Key Steps:
	•	Funding data conversion and cleaning
	•	Outlier detection using IQR
	•	Hypothesis testing on operating status vs funding
	•	Proportion analysis between winners and contestants
	•	Event-based filtering and segmentation
	•	Boxplots and bar plots for visual analysis

📌 Outcome:

Insights on how funding varies between operating vs closed startups, correlation between event results and current status, and suggestions for improving data quality (5Vs: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Value).
